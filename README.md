RealTime Dynamic Video clips Recommendation using sentimental Analysis.

Current systems in place are static and generic in nature and donâ€™t take into consideration the ever changing human behavior and 
lack the ability to incorporate the user's implicit feedback while making relevant movie recommendations and intern have a negative 
impact on the user experience. To address these challenges I attempt to provide a novel approach using sentimental analysis across social networks to provide a dynamic real time recommendation.
